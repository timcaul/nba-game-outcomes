Workbooks, results, and data from "Using Machine Learning to Predict NBA Game Outcomes"

The GitHub has 2 folders, one with all code from the project, and 1 with all the data required to run the code. The code folder has folders for each notebook with that notebook's corresponding code. The only alteration needed to run the code is to change the source of the data in the read_csv lines to your local directory. The notebook folder also contains the PowerBI file, basketball_eda.pbix, containing the results from EDA. Upload this file to PowerBI to view the dashboard.
